# IBCSHL-IA
What I completed for my Computer Science IA for the International Baccalaureate program.

But before you do anything with this, I recommend reading your intended group for more information BEFORE you start.

## International Baccalaureate (IB) Students
Okay, I get it. You're one of the students that's looking for an idea for their IA project. In that case, go ahead and download the program and see what it can do. But I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND finding a different project lest you get caught for "academic dishonesty". 

Or, you can wait until copyright ends when I die + 70 years. But I'm not dead yet, so...there you go. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
